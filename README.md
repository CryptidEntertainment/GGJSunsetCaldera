# Sunset Caldera

Repository for our [Global Game Jam 2020](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/crater-crash-9) game.

You've crash-landed on an alien planet, and you need to repair your space ship. Equipped with a Non-Trademarked™ Gravity Gun, you must find the missing pieces scattered around the map and plop them back into the ship (no installation required; recommended ages 4+). The local alien wildlife is friendly, but they have unusual ways of demonstrating affection so you should probably watch out.

Seeing how far you can chucking stuff with the Non-Trademarked™ Gravity Gun is not required, but strongly recommended.

The game isn't designed to be overly difficult, and there's no real penalty for dying other than respawning back near the ship.

## Making

This was made in Unity 2019.3.06f, and should work out-of-the-box with only a few editor warnings. Older and future versions may work as well, but we haven't tried them in anything else yet.
